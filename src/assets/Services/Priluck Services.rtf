\b \ul Implant Dentistry
\b0 \uc0\u8232 Dental implants are a great option for replacing missing teeth, improving chewing ability, eliminating bridges, and replacing dentures. Several implants may provide a base for a series of artificial teeth known as a fixed bridge. Implants can even be used to secure a full set of removable dentures for people who have no remaining natural teeth.

Made to perfectly match the shape and shade of your other teeth, they\'92re durable, strong, and undetectable.\u8232 \u8232 Crowns should be placed before the tooth is so decayed that it may fracture. This can often help prevent the expense of root canal therapy in the future. If a tooth is too damaged to have a crown applied, a porcelain bridge may be a good alternative.
